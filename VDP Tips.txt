## Trying for 1st VDP?

BEFORE STARTING TO READ THIS, U MUST NEED A ROBUST KNOWLEDGE OF LINUX COMMAND (try to use vmware for kali if u are a extreme beginner and over time u will able to switch to 
wsl) ALSO U SHOULD KNOW AND PRACTICE OWASP TOP 10 VULNS. TRY PORTSWIGGER LABS,HTB.THM, OWASP JUICY SHOP ETC

Ok LETS START!!!

> MASTER RECON
> DIGGING SUBDOMAIN ENUM TECHNIQUES
> DISCOVER THE ART OF PORT RECON AND DIG DEEPER
> USE CENSYS AND SHODAN
>  USE TOOLS LIKE DNSX AND ALTERX FOR FINDING BRUTEFORCING SUBDOMAINS
> IF FOUND A SENSITIVE SUBDOMAIN WITH AUTH PAGE  >>403 OK THEN TRY TO FIND ORIGIN IP AND BYPASS THE AUTHENTICATION FUNCTIONALTY
>  TRY FOR BASIC ATTACKS (P3 P4)
> AFTER LEARN WAYS TO BYPASS XSS FILTERS
> TRY FOR STORED XSS ...might be a easy one also try for *reflected xss* vulns as these can be understood by a beginner.
